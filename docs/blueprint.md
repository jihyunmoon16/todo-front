# **App Name**: Eisenhower Matrix

## Core Features:

- Dashboard View: Dashboard view with tabs for 'Today' and 'This Week', displaying todos filtered by date and sorted by Eisenhower quadrant priority (Q2 -> Q1 -> Q3 -> Q4).
- Add/Edit Todo: Modal for adding and editing todos with fields for title, description, due date (calendar), tag, and Eisenhower quadrant priority selection (Q1-Q4).
- Todo Completion: Toggle for task completion status.
- Pomodoro Timer: Pomodoro timer integration (default 25m) to track time spent on tasks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark gray (#333333) to provide a comfortable, serious and focused atmosphere conducive to task management.
- Background color: Even darker gray (#1E1E1E) for a deep, unobtrusive background.
- Accent color: Violet (#BB86FC), 30 degrees to the left of dark gray in hue, chosen for higher brightness and saturation, providing visual contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for a modern, machined, neutral look.
- Use simple, minimalist icons to represent task categories and actions.
- Emphasize clear visual hierarchy to reflect Eisenhower Matrix principles. Group tasks within respective quadrants.
- Use subtle transitions for modal openings and task status updates.
